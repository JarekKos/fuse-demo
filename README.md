[ONLINE DEMO](https://fuse-demo.herokuapp.com/) is available and can be a good starting point.

Alternatively, project can be run on a local machine (read the instructions below).

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--target=production` flag for a production build.

To make code of application even smaller, you should consider run build option with `--aot` flag.
